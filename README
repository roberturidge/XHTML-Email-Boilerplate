The XHTML Email Boilerplate is meant as a starting point for any HTML Email Template. It contains fixes for many common browser bugs and a table structure 600px wide. I have also included examples for links, headings (h2-h6 hotmail colour fix) and images all of which can cause problems if not treated correctly.
